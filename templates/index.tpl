<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> Welcome to the Module Two of PULSE@Parkes project (I MIGHT WANT A LINK HERE). The goal of this activity is to calculate the age of a pulsar. Take a moment to think about how you would go about guessing the age of: 1) a tree, 2) the person next to you, and 3) ... 

<p> How old do you think a pulsar is? A couple of years old? Maybe a century or two? The method used to calculate the characteristic age of the pulsar is... (((FILL THIS IN)) The calculation can be performed using this formula:
<pre> age(s) = P(s) / 2 * pDot(s) </pre>

{*
<p> The parameters in this formula probably won't mean anything to you now. Your job is to reach the stage where you can plug in the appropriate numbers and determine the age of a pulsar.

<p> Let's click 'Continue' to get started.
